If its a platform device, it will appear in /dev/v4l/by-path/
you can make udev rules, I personally use the GstDeviceMonitor and check the attributes, like USB port its connected to

meson devenv -C build

gst-launch-1.0 libcamerasrc camera-name="Camera 1" ! queue ! glimagesink

OK so; long story short the ACPI is broken. ACPI - in case you're not aware of it - is a kind of firmware that describes the platform, all the hardware and what resources each bit has access to and so on. It's notoriously badly broken on these platform to the extent that we have multiple bits of code that exist for the sole purpose of fixing it up - hurrah.

Setting the resource enforcement to lax by the way is a matter of updating /etc/default/grub with
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet acpi_enforce_resources=lax")
